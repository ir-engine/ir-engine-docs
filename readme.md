# ⚠️ DEPRECATED PROJECT ⚠️

This repository is no longer maintained. The documentation has been migrated to the [developer-docs repository](https://github.com/ir-engine/developer-docs).

This repository contains the legacy documentation from Ethereal Engine. It was used as a reference when forking the new [developer-docs](https://github.com/ir-engine/developer-docs) project to ensure continuity while improving the documentation.

For the latest and actively maintained documentation, please visit the [developer-docs repository](https://github.com/ir-engine/developer-docs), which serves as the source for our [official developer site](https://docs.ir.world/developers).
